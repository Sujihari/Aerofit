Analysis Scope:

Descriptive Statistics: Compute descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for each numerical variable (Age, Education, Usage, Income, Fitness, Miles).

Distribution Analysis: Visualize the distributions of numerical variables using histograms or density plots to understand their spread.

Categorical Analysis: Analyze the distribution of categorical variables (Gender, MaritalStatus, Product Purchased) using bar plots to understand the composition of the dataset.

Correlation Analysis: Examine correlations between numerical variables using correlation matrices or scatter plots to identify potential relationships.

Data Preprocessing: Handling Missing Values: Check for missing values in each column. Decide on an appropriate strategy to handle missing values, such as imputation (e.g., using mean, median, or mode) or removal of rows or columns with missing values.

Handling Categorical Variables: Convert categorical variables (Gender, MaritalStatus, Product Purchased) into numerical representations using one-hot encoding or label encoding. Ensure consistent encoding across all categorical variables.

Feature Scaling: Check the scales of numerical variables (Age, Education, Usage, Income, Fitness, Miles). Scale numerical variables if necessary to bring them to a similar scale, using techniques like min-max scaling or standardization.

Outlier Detection and Removal: Identify outliers in numerical variables using statistical methods

Recommendations:

Strategies for Targeted Marketing: Market campaigns should be customized according to the usage and demographics of your customers. For instance, concentrate on marketing high-end treadmill models (like the KP781) to clients that anticipate walking or running longer distances every week and have greater finances.

Product Creation: Based on requests from customers, create new features or accessories for treadmill models. For example, offer more sophisticated tracking tools to clients who value fitness and anticipate walking or running greater distances in order to track their progress and mileage.

Optimization of Price: Price tactics should be optimized according to consumer segments. For the purpose of drawing in clients with moderate salaries and usage expectations, think about providing incentives or discounts for mid-range treadmill models (KP481, for example).

Customer service and support: Give outstanding customer service and help to quickly resolve any problems or issues. Having a positive experience as a consumer can boost loyalty and satisfaction.

Constant Observation and Evaluation: Keep an eye on market developments, sales statistics, and customer feedback to adjust offerings and tactics as needed. Analyze data continuously to find new areas for development and enhancement.
